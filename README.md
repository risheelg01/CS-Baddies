# Git Reviews

Git Reviews is a website that provides users with comprehensive and informative reviews of the latest movies. The website has a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to quickly and easily find the movie they're interested in and read an expert analysis of the film.

The frontend of this website is developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The integration of these languages enables the development of the website and all its interactive features in the user interface. The process starts with the initial page, which includes a movie gallery for the background, a search bar, and a button to initiate the review and recommendation processes of the backend

As for the backend, the website utilizes Python web scraping to retrieve reviews for the user. Once the user inputs the name of a movie, it is converted into a readable string, which is then used to web scrape the Rotten Tomatoes review database. The BeautifulSoup library is used to extract all the reviews, and the TextBlob library is used to create a sentiment analysis tool that concludes a composite review through emotion and text analysis. Finally, Django is used to connect the backend to the front end, which informs the user whether their movie is 'good' or 'bad'.

GitHub, Trello, and Figma are used to track progress and create mockups for the application. GitHubâ€™s main purpose is to track the progress of the code as well as allow everyone to collaborate and work on the code together. We created a repository for every part of the project to help visualize the code. Trello was used as a project management tool where we put all our tasks into the software to keep track of what assignments we worked on throughout the development of the website. Figma was used as the main tool to create the mockups for the interface. This mockup helped us model the actual website on the frontend.
